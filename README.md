# Word-Guess-Game

This is a hangman game with pop singers theme!

The game starts when the user presses any key or clicks on the keyboard (shown in the small devices only).

When the game starts the blank spaces for the word is shown and the user guesses pressing the key.

If the user hits the word, a singer's song is played (with a victory sound effect). If the user loses, the background sound still playing the last music started and a defeated sound effect is played.

There is a score that counts the number of wins and the loses. For each word there's score of guesses remained that goes down with the image of the hangman.
